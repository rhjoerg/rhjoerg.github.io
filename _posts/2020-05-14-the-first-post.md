Hi there.

This post should have a better title.

It is here, so I don't forget some of the tricks required to write these posts.

... like adding code snippets:
{% highlight java %}
System.out.println("hello, world!");
{% endhighlight %}

... or [reusing][github] the same [link][github] multiple times.
