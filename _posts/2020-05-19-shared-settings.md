As the number of repositories is increasing, the number of repositories to manage is increasing.

To keep the LICENSE file and the maven settings.xml file consistent among all repositories I developed
a small Java Application which does this for me.

The project can be found at the [rhj-shared repository](https://github.com/rhjoerg/rhj-shared).
