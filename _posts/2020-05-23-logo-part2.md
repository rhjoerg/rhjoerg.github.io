## The Solution

I am creating the logo sizes using good old `Graphics2D`.

I found a Helvetica-like font (Neue Haas Grotesk Text Pro) within the Windows 10 distribution (installation of an app required). Although the
required font doesn't show up in the Font folder of the system, `GraphicsEnvironment::getAllFonts()` lists it.

## The Result

| 128 x 128 | 64 x 64 | 48 x 48 | 32 x 32 | 24 x 24 | 16 x 16 |
